# CS-230-template-showcase

The Gaming Room is a theoretical software development company who was trying to develop a small web browser game that would be able to reach and run on different platforms and operating systems. We were given a few tasks in completeing small sections of the code that defined user permissions. The major project however was the design template that goes over the different focus points that must be addressed before the game is actually developed. 

I found the document rather straight forward to fill out, the only issue being understanding the information needed to fill out each section. The analysis of the different operating systems was by far the easiest part of the template. 

I found that looking at the design document and working through it while we were working with our code helped me to understand a bit more what we were doing at each step. If I could go back and revise some of my previous work I would have to revise some of my statements in the recommendation section of the template. Every time I read through what I wrote I find a better way to phrase something. 

In this project we ensured the user's program had proper permissions for the different user types so that certain functions wouldn't be widely accessible. It's important to keep the user's needs in mind when we design out code otherwise we run the risk of making something that they won't even want by the end of it due to not including everything needed.

When I was designing the software for this class I took each task by itself and made sure it was complete before moving on to any other. This technique has served me well these past few classes, and I intend to continue this strategy until a better one presents itself.
